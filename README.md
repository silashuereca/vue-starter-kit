# Starter Project (Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite)
## Client Side (SSR version coming soon?)
## setup
`yarn install`

`yarn dev`

## Benefits from using this starter project
1. Lots of time at the current company I work at worked on the propert eslint configurations that play nice with both Prettier and Eslint. Using this starter project saves you all the headache with that. Big shoutout to [Phil](https://github.com/philwhln) for helping out with this. He's a wizard at solving any problem you throw at him.
2. Pinia store setup
3. Testing for JS functions and Vue components with TypeScript make for even better quality testing practices
4. TypeScript support/configuration

I hope this helps motivate you to build those side projects since all the boring/setup is taken care of for you :)
