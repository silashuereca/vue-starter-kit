# Starter Project (Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite)
## Client Side (SSR version coming soon?)
## setup
`yarn install`

`yarn dev`

NOTE: should have `Node version 16+` installed on your computer

## Benefits from using this starter project
1. I spent a lot of time at my current company working on the propert eslint configurations that play nice with both Prettier and Eslint. Using this starter project saves you all the headache with that. Big shoutout to [Phil](https://github.com/philwhln) for helping out with this. He's a wizard at solving any problem you throw at him.
2. Pinia store setup
3. Router setup with 404 page catch
4. Testing for JS functions and Vue components with TypeScript make for even better quality testing practices
5. TypeScript support/configuration
6. Basic Git Action workflow setup to check for linting/test errors
7. Basic overall folder/file architecture setup

I hope this helps motivate you to build those side projects since all the boring/setup is taken care of for you :)
